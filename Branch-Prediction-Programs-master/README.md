# Branch-Prediction-Programs
branch.cpp and branch2.cpp are 1-bit and 2-bit branch predictor programs respectively. It requires a trace file to operate on.
It predicts the branch and prints out the number of correct predictions, wrong prediction and buffer misses. When used with a trace file with a lot of hot brances, the program does a very good prediction and helps improving the execution time.
